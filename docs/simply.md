Why most people don't try to come up with the simplest design?

Why most people don't try to use the simplest solution to solve a problem?

Why not use the solution with fewer parameters?

Why not use the smallest code?

Why most people do not try to simplify existing products?

It is easy to sell complexity.
It is easy to sell more features.
It is easy to appear smart to propose a complex solution.
It is easy to write a far-fetched article.

I love mathematics, physics, and science.
They are always trying to explain everything with fewer axioms, with the smallest formulas.
They want to unify many theories into fewer ones.

It is interesting how "simple" things can generate complex systems.
Mandelbrot formula is so simple but generates amazing fractals.
Einstein's Mass-energy Equation is just 3 letters and it is so profound.

When designing something new, always try to come up with the simplest design possible.

When modifying an existing system, try to simplify and reduce entropy before adding new features.

Artificial Inteligence is our best signal-noise filter.
AI will help us simplify everything.
Complexity is entropy and noise.
