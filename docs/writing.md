I use writing to scale myself.

Writing let me structure my thoughts and ideas.

Writing is how I communicate with the world.

Writing transforms the implicit into explicit.

Writing in public improves your personal SEO.

Writing is essential in the async communication workplace if you want to avoid being 24/7 in meetings.

Everybody has something to write about it. 

Everybody has something to share with the world.
