Most people find a problem or a bug and let them go unfixed.

I'm not like that. I'm a fixer. I fix things. I fix bugs. I fix problems. I fix stuff.

When I find a problem, I try to see if this is an easy fix. If this is an easy fix, I fixed it right all way.

Otherwise, if the fix is not so easy, I try to ask for help on twitter, discord, github, stackoverflow.

If the problem is not solved after sometime, I try to fix it myself again.
