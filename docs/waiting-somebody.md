Most people keep waiting somebody else to figure something out.

Developers wait the product manager to tell them what to do.

You are waiting someone in your team to discuss something.

You think you are "blocked", however you are not.

You are blocking yourself because it is easier.

You don't want to take responsiblity. 

You don't want to make a mistake or be wrong.

Here my advice for you, stop waiting and start doing.

The world is for the ones who take action.

Nobody will fix your problems for you.
