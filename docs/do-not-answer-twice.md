I have a principles that it is called "Do not answer twice"

The idea is that I don't want to answer the same question more than once.

This sounds like a crazy optimization idea, but in my scale it is needed.

After I've founded React community in Brazil, and start answering many questions every day.
Then, I realize that most of the questions will repeat themselves once in a while, like a cycle.

I decide to stop answer questions in private, and asking people to ask their questions in public on Twitter and tag me.
I did a retweet of their questions, and answered them in public.

So, you someone else asks the same question, I just reuse my answer.

I write answers as tweets, tweet threads, blog posts, articles, and here in my zettelkasten.
