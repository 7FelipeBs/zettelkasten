## work visibility

"Are there specific strategies to increase the visibility and recognition of my work within the company where I will be interning?"

It is the same way that you get your work visible outside your company.
You use Learn in public.
You share all the work you are doing in public, in public channels, in articles, at open source.

You write down everything you are contributing to the company, brag document.
Your manage can forget what you did, but you should not. You should let know how you are contributing to the company.

You need to prove that your work contributions are moving the metrics that matters.
Does your work reduces costs? increase revenue? simplify onboarding? reduces CACs ? make team ship faster?

"It's better to appear honest than to be honest"

You need to market your work. Only work or coding is not enough, you need to demo, present to other areas.
