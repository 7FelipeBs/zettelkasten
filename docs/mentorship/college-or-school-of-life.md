## college or school of life

Do a College in these situations:

You don't have the discipline to learn by yourself
You are not used to self-taught
You are not getting a job
You and/or your family have enough money to sustain you for 4/5 years without earning a lot
Prefer to do Public College in Brazil like USP, Unicamp, they are the best.
You want to validate if you want to work in business or in research
You want to work in FAANG, Big Tech, or move abroad where they value and require a degree.
To get networking and friends and college experience.
This network can help you go higher in your carrer later on.

Do not do College in these situations, or for these reasons:

You just want a degree, the diploma.
You need money right it way
You are a self-taught
You already got a job as a developer

Prefer a technical course or a bootcamp if you wanna go to market fast.

Everything that you can learn on College you can learn outside college.
Go check the syllabus of the course and read the textbooks. Do the exercises to really learn
