## how to prioritize learning

"How can I identify and prioritize which technologies or programming languages to learn given long-term career goals?"

Learn what will help you achieve your goals first.

If you want to get your first job, learn the tech stack that most companies are loooking for.

If they are looking for Go, you learn Go.
You learn Go and show that you can build using Go what they are needing.
That you can build a CRUD API with Go, that you can implement event driven with Go.
That you can create automation using Go.
Study the company, the products, the problems they are facing.
And how can you solve it using the tech stack that they use.

You need to balance with topics that you need right now.
For instance, we need to improve a lot our DevOps workflow, so I spend a lot of time studying and testing a lot of DevOps workflows.
I also studied things that I won't use on DevOps right now, but can be useful in the future.
