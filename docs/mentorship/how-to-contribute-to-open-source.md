## how to contribute to open source?

"Are there specific projects or types of open source contributions that you would recommend to someone in my current career (internship)?"

You can contribute to any open source project.
If you say you can't, it is a barrier that you created.

I would recommend contribute and be comfortable with open source.

First, watch the repo that you want to contribute.
Start contributing answers all open issues.
Also do code review of all open pull requests.
Read all the code and documentation to see if you can contribute with some easy stuff first.
As you go, you can contribute.

You only be able to contribute meaninfully for packages/libraries/projects that you use.
If you don't use a project you can't contribute, because you don't know what is good or bad, or what is missing.
You need to use the project and feel the pain.
After that it will be easy to see what is missing, and you can have some idea of how to contribute.
