## common challenges for developers in the beginning

"What are the most common challenges faced by developers early in their career and how can I prepare myself to face them?"

One common challenge is to decide what kind of developer you want to be: backend, frontend, fullstack, mobile, devops, other.

My advice is to be more generalist at the beginning of your carrer, test everything until you decide what you like more to do.

Another challenge is to be able to learn a lot of new things that come up every day.

My advice for this is to focus more on concepts over implementations. Concepts are much more stable than implementation.
HTML, CSS and JavaScript is much more stable than React.

Learn to be invariant to implementations: learn React, Angular, Vue, and make it easy to learn a new framework as they show up.
Learn databases, and be able to learn a new database faster.

Always focus on how can you learn a new thing faster.

Another challenge for juniors is to proof they are worth to hire.

My advice is to do everything in public. Write articles, Open source your code. Deploy to production.
You need proof of work. Get all public code challenges of companies that you want to work.
Study the companies and how that you can solve their problems.

You can also work for free to get experience

You need experience.
Use freelances or any work that show up to get experience

Contribute to open source to get experience

You need to master your tech tack, your IDE, terminal, automated testes, how to develop software properly with feature flags.
