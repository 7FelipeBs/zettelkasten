## project transitions

"How can I transition from personal projects to more complex or commercial technology projects?"

The only way is to go to production.

You can't learn using only personal projects that do not have outside users/customers.

You need real users to provide feedback to see if your product is good or bad, and if your code is good or bad.

You need a side project with real users, or you need to get freelancers or a real job

At Woovi we are learning a lot everyday because we have more and more users using our product at scale.
