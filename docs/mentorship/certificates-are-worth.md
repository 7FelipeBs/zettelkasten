## certificates are worth

"Are there specific certifications or courses you would recommend to complement hands-on learning and personal projects?"

I prefer to learn from primary sources, and they are most books over courses on youtube, udemy.

Textbooks are great to learn from primary source.

You can learn from a variaty of sources like text, audio, video, books, courses, certificates.

You should focus more on learning and knowledge.

Prefer active learning methods where you need to do exercises, build something to validate that you are really learning.

The real value of the "certificate" is the knowledge that it will give you.

You only learn when doing, so do not focus a lot on getting the certificate badge.
