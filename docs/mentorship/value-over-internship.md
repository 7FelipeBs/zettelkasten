## value over internship

"How can I effectively demonstrate my value and skills during the internship to maximize the chances of a job offer at the end of it?"

Work as hard as you can

Work more hours

Do more than they asked you

Understand your company, your company's products and the business.
How they make money.

How can you contribute to the company, to make more money, to reduce costs, to grow faster, to bring more users, to reduce churn, to make onboarding easy.

Learn everything that you can

Do not reduce yourself as an intern, try to solve harder problems

Ask for challenges

Do not limit yourself to your job title, only frontend, only backend.
Learn it all.
Contribute it all.

Bring new ideias with RFC, POCs.

Reduce the work of your Boss

Deliver everything with high quality.
