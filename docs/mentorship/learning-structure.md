## learning structure

"How can I structure my learning to cover both the fundamental bases and emerging technologies in programming?"

Focus on concepts

Structure as a roadmap - things that you need to learn, and things that you need to build

Check my [Learning Paths](https://sibelius.github.io/zettelkasten/category/learning-path)

You need to learn the theory, but you need to build to get the practice, and understand how really works

the new tech is just an implementation detail of existing concepts
