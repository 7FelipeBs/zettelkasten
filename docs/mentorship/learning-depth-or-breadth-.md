## learning depth or breadth ?

"How can I effectively balance the desire to learn new technologies with the need to deepen my knowledge of the ones I am already studying?"

My advice here is to focus more on solving problems.
And solving a new problem usually is a combination of solving some existing problem that you already solved,
some problems that you don't know how to solve, and some knowledge and experience that you have and some that you are missing.

Most of the time you should focus on breadth if you want to solve more kind of problems.
You focus in learning few about a lot of things.

If you want to solve better a kind of problem you need to go in depth.
You focus in learning a lot about a few things.

You need to balance these approaches.

I usually only go deep when my current knowldge/experience is not enough to solve the problem that I have to solve.
