## work study life balance

"What strategies do you suggest for balancing ongoing technology learning with the demands of work and personal life?"

The best way is to align your work with what you want to learn.

For instance, if you want to study more React, the best way is to get a job that uses React every day.

You will get paid to study and learn what you are looking for.

If you can't do that in your current job, you have some options.

You can introduce this new technology in your work if this makes sense.
Write an RFC (Request For Comments) showing all the benefits of this new technology for the company current tech stack.
Do a simple POC (Proof of Concept).

You can get another job that uses this new tech.

You can get a freelancer to learn more this new tech.

You just need to be able to learn fast until they figure it out that you don't have everything figure it out.

To balance your work with your life, you need to work in something that you believe.
You need to optimize and automate the work, so you can be able to be very productive and work for 6/8 hours.
Working extra time can be useful in the beginning of the carrer so you can grow faster.
Always work hard for yourself.
Every time you are working on something more hours, and you are learning a lot, it is good for your carrer and for your company.
