## when to change jobs

"How I can decide when is the correct time to change my job? I think that is when I dont learning more at my actual job..."

You should change jobs when you are not learning anymore, or when you are not earning as much as you should.
You should also change jobs when you don't believe in your company mission.
You should also change job if your job is too easy.
You should change jobs when you can't grow.
