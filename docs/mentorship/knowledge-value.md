## knowledge value

"How I can calculate values of my knowlege? Example: My cost about work far away from home is R$2.866,80/month.
But I learning a lot that put in balance is worth. Exists a away to calculate this?"

Knowledge does not have an intrisic value.
The value of knowledge is related to their scarcity and demand.

If you know something that a lot of people and companies need, and a few people know it, you can charge a lot for it.

If you think you are not earning as much as you should, you should try to ask for a raise, or switch jobs.

Let the market decide how much your knowledge is worth.
The more worth the easier is to get a raise or switch jobs.
