## keep up to date

"How can I stay up to date with trends and changes in technology given the rapid development of the field?"

You can't

You need to prioritize

You can reduce your learning curve, adding more nodes and edges to your knowledge graph

If you think about it, the "new things" are just the existing building blocks recombined.

So you need to focus on learn these building blocks and learning a new thing it will be easy

You could also be the one creating the new thing.
