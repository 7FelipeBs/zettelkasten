# July 16th, 2023

## Personal

I will at SÃ£o Carlos, SP this week until Sunday (23th).
Let me know if you want to catch up or work together in some coworking space.

I'm reading a lot about teams, management, leadership, I will share some thoughts on this on tweets.

## Woovi

I wrote 5 technical articles about cool stuff we are building at Woovi

- [Why you should use a hidden replica set member](https://dev.to/woovi/why-you-should-use-a-hidden-replica-set-member-4268)
- [Zero downtime database migrations at Woovi](https://dev.to/woovi/zero-downtime-database-migrations-at-woovi-cc7)
- [Instrumentation for Event Drive](https://dev.to/woovi/instrumentation-for-event-driven-3k1m)
- [Multi-language Landing Page with Nextjs](https://dev.to/woovi/multi-language-landing-page-with-nextjs-50e1)
- [Best DX for MongoDB Replica Set](https://dev.to/woovi/best-dx-for-mongodb-replica-set-43lc)

We have so much cool stuff happening at Woovi, I have already to two more articles to be reviewed and published.

Let me know if you want to review, or if you have ideas of topics that we should cover on.

Next week we will be at [Forum E-commerce Brasil](https://eventos.ecommercebrasil.com.br/), you should come visit us.

## Community

[Emanuel](https://twitter.com/manelferreira_) will start doing some call with community members to see how can we improve.
