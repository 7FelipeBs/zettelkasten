# Sep 17th, 2023

## Woovi

I kept doing more hiring interview calls to CS and Sales team.

I kept doing implementation with new customers to increase conversion rates.

We launched an improved payment link to ask for customer data.

We also launched the Wake integration.

We had so many errors on sentry because of wrong sendToSlack calls that we reached our quota.
We solved this using a validation that breaks on tests.

We also had many errors from other websites that used our plugin js.
We solved this avoiding default Sentry setup and only catching errors in a custom error boundary.

We also fixed our sentry integration with Koa
