## Woovi

I went to a rabbit hole to fix Maquininha Pix for Windows using electron and printers.

I've learned a lot about native node development and dependencies, also about webpack and electron.

I also learned about Windows development. Powershell is not so bad after all.

Woovi is improving in more and more innnovation, stay tuned.

There are a lot of innovation to happen in the Pix space.
