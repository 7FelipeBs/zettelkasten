# Sep 10th, 2023

## Woovi

It was a shorter week!

We are improving our ledger to enable more complex features for our customers.

We are finishing the new Maquininha Pix App.

We are doing a lot of hiring calls to increase our CS team to improve conversion rates and reduce churn.

Our Shopify integration is live and we have some customers using it already.

There are many bugs yet to make Bun works in Woovi codebase.
