# Jan 7th, 2024

## Sibelius

My first week of the month I was in São Carlos.

I went to Onovolab coworking in São Carlos to work with [Eduardo](https://twitter.com/edumaciel10_) at Magalu Labs/Cloud.

We discussed how to operate bare metal hardware and build their own cloud.

We also talked about the Magalu Pay project.

I also talked to [Bruno Orlandi](https://twitter.com/BrOrlandi), and how my experience can help him as a new CTO.

## Woovi

We are reorganizing all ORKs and business plan for the year.

We are focusing on make our platform more stable and reliable.

Distributed systems are hard, ledgers are hard, everything at scale is hard.
Every day we make it faster and more reliable.

## Articles and Content

Some people asked me to more long form content, so I wrote 23 articles on some topics that I think it is useful for developers and startups.

They are also related to my work as CTO of Woovi, as a mentor of developers and as a consultant for startups.

I've published 4 of them in substack

And 4 of them in [Woovi dev.to](https://dev.to/woovi)
