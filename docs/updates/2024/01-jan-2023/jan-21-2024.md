## Sibelius

I talked to [Jeferson](https://github.com/jefersoneiji) here at Florianópolis.
He made the [OpenPix Prestashop](https://github.com/jefersoneiji/openpix-prestashop) bounty.
He is passionate to learn, if you want an eager Junior to learn and grow, you should hire him!

## Woovi

We are decoupling user from company to make onboarding simpler, faster, easier and safe.
This will also enable fast switch for users with multi companies.

After a lot of years running k8s, we are still learning a lot about it.
We had to recreate our k8s dev cluster from scratch, because we used a lot of disk because of snapshots.

We are removing a lot of tech debt from our transaction ledger implementation.

We are also improving our split payments implementations to provide better reports.

We finished a new version of Maquininha Pix.

We improved a lot our cohorts in realtime.

We upgraded a lot of packages, and our servers are faster than ever.

We are adding more tests for our elasticsearch integration

We are spending a lot of time on customer support and sales to understand customer needs and improve our product.

We're also working on videos to make it easy to customers to learn our product:

We are growing faster our revenue, planned to 20% or more this month.
