## Sibelius

I spend the week in SÃ£o Paulo at Woovi.

I was able to visit an old friend that is living at Dubai, Renan Menezes, [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/menezesrenan/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/renan_menezes).
He is migrating from civil engineering to software engineering.
You should hire him!

## Woovi

We visited one of our partner [Pepper](http://peppersoftware.com.br/) that provides PDV software for restaurants and pizza stores.

We also visited one of our pizza store customer [Nova Bella Napoli](https://pizzarianovabellanapoli.com.br/), to understand how they operate and use our platform.

We received a visit from [Leandro](https://twitter.com/leandronsp) to discuss some ideas and projects.

We are making the platform more stable to be able to innovate even more.
