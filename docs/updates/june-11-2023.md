# June 11th, 2023

## Personal

I spent the last sunny day (Saturday) at the beach with friends.

I ran the 10k run at 42k Florianopólis marathon.

## Woovi

We went to VTEX Day event, and we talk to a lot of great customers, and we got a lot of new leads.
It is always wonderful to talk to customers.

We spent the whole week at São Paulo with Woovi team.
Presential work can be very productivity and help with team building.

We are improving our KYC process.

We are finishing the pixel perfect to launch new Woovi products soon, stay tuned.
