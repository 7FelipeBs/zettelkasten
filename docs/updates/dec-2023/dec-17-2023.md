# Dec 17th, 2023

## Woovi

We released a new 1click onboarding to onboard new pizza customers faster.

## Community

To join the developer one, you need to sponsor me on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sibelius) or Pix.
You also get the community if you got a mentorship with me [Mentorship Developers](../../paid-mentorship-developers.mdx)

To join the startup one, you need to have a working product in production, and working to get your first customers.
If you just have an idea, you are not eligible to join.
We are using [patreon](https://patreon.com/LeanHackers) to handle subscriptions.

## Mentorship & Consulting

I'm back with mentoring for developers and startups, send me a DM if you are interested
