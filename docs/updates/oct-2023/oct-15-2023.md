## Woovi

More work on Maquininha Pix to enable more use cases.

More work on Ledger abstraction to use it everywhere.

More work on onboarding, KYC and Sales automation to make onboarding faster.

More work on customer demands to make our customers happy.

We are also working hard to reduce the entropy of our codebase.
Removing a lot of legacy code.

We also made webpack even faster and consume fewer memory.

## Community

It is hard to find a good place to discuss hard tech and startups.

Twitter for this is broken.

My community is kind of broken on this as well.

If you wanna discuss hard tech and startups ping me.
