## Woovi

We are improving our Outbound strategy.

We are also working on more ledger abstractions, like JournalEntry to make our code more declarative.

We are shipping a new archictecture to our Maquininha Pix to enable even more use cases.

[Danilo](https://twitter.com/daniloab_) and [Marins](https://twitter.com/jgcmarins) each of them are leading one Woovi squad.

Squads and domain driven design are the way to scale teams and code.

We moved our staging environment to our own hardware.
It is a [Dell t550](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/ipovw/poweredge-t550#techspecs_section).
This will save a lot of our costs and pay offs in 3 months.

## Community

[Relay Workshop](https://github.com/sibelius/relay-workshop) is broken,
if someone wants to upgrade the codebase to use react-router v6 would be great.

I've talked to [Intuita](https://www.intuita.io/) CoFounder about codemods.
The idea of Intuita is to make it easier to write and run code migrations at scale.
