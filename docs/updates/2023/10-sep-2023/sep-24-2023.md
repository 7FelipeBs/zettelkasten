## Woovi

The new hire Woovi CSI (Customer Success Implementation) will start working with us on Monday.  
She will be responsible to make sure new customers understand the benefits of the platform,
and they are integrated properly in their workflows and e-commerce.

I was doing this job, and now I'm moving to something else.

We now have leader to our squads: Danilo and Jgcmarins.
The idea is to bring more ownership and to improve the quality of our code and product.

We published @woovi/ui on npm, it is still missing to be open source, storybooks and docs.

I did some infrastructure improvement on webpack, jest, storybook.

I also check if all our indexes in staging and production are correct with our mongoose definition.

## Personal

I did a few free mentoring sessions for people building their Startups.
The common mistakes are:

- not talking to customers
- too much scope
- lack of a good problem to be solved
