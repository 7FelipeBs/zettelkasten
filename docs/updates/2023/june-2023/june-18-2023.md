# June 18th, 2023

## Personal

I finished my talk Intern to CTO to [Dev Stack Summit](https://www.devstacksummit.com/).
I did this talk internally as a trial at Woovi mini talks.
You can watch the talk live at 23th June at 10:00 AM (GMT-3).

I will participate in a podcast this week about Resiliancy (software, engineering, infra),
let me know if you have any topics that I should cover there

## Woovi

We solved many circular depedencies in our backend.
The decoupling of the backend is a pain, but it is already paying off.

We opened up many new features, and we are focusing on reducing WIP and close most of them right now.

We land the new improvement to decoupling of our webhook service.

We also have realtime cohort of many aspects of our business that let us understand better our customers.

We have WhatsApp for Customer Success, and we are going to release WhatsApp for Sales and for our product and customers.
