# Oct 29th, 2023

## Woovi

We are focusing on finishing 2 new products and launching them to our customers.

## Community

My community was deleted. It deviated a lot from the original purpose.

I'm working on 2 new paid communities: one for developers and the other for startups/creators.

To join the developer one, you need to sponsor me on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sibelius) or Pix.
You also get the community if you got a mentorship with me [Mentorship Developers](../../../paid-mentorship-developers.mdx)

To join the startup one, you need to have a working product in production, and working to get your first customers.
If you just have an idea, you are not eligible to join.

## Mentorship & Consulting

I'm back with mentoring for developers and startups, send me a DM if you are interested

- [Consulting Startups](../../../paid-consulting-startups.mdx)
- [Mentorship Developers](../../../paid-mentorship-developers.mdx)
