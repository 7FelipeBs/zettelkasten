# July 23th, 2023

## Personal

I went to Wikilab to work with Pedro Arantes, Paulo GDM (Vercel), and Danilo (Sigalei).
It is great to talk and discuss ideas with friends.

I also meet Isaac that is building [Leme Tech](https://www.instagram.com/Leme.tec_/).
A product to help public school managers.

## Woovi

We will be at [Forum E-commerce Brasil](https://eventos.ecommercebrasil.com.br/), you should visit us.

I wrote more 4 technical articles about the cool stuff we are building at Woovi

- [Debugging nested objects](https://dev.to/woovi/debugging-nested-objects-6a9)
- [Drawbacks of IP whitelist](https://dev.to/woovi/drawbacks-of-ip-whitelist-je0)
- [Using Webpack to slim your Docker image](https://dev.to/woovi/using-webpack-to-slim-your-docker-image-1b1n)
- [Best way to run Migrations in Production](https://dev.to/woovi/best-way-to-run-migrations-in-production-ehg)

We shipped Web Push Notifications to our customers.

We shipped Woovi Parcelado to Woocommerce.

We shipped the Woovi plugin for Opencart

We are using our Publisher service to make Woovi more event-driven.
