I removed my braces after a while.

We released our VTEX Woovi Plugin to our customers, a few customers are already integrating.

We released Pix Crediario to all customers, we have some customers using it.

We are unblocking 2 new integrations: Nuvemshop and Shopify.

We translated our website to English.
