# Dec 31th, 2023

Writing a retrospective of an year can be hard if you didn't take notes during the year.
Trying to remember what happened during the year is hard, and you will forget a lot of things.
For instance, I have updates for every week since June 2023, but when I try to remember what happened before that, I can't remember anything.
For this reason, make sure to keep a changelog of your life updates, so you can look back and see what you accomplished in a year.
