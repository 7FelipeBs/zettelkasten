# Dec 10th, 2023

## Woovi

We are focusing a lot on Customer Support bugs and demands.
With the new 204 new customers, they are using a lot our platform uncovering a lot of "bugs" and asking for improvements.
We have 3 developers focused just on that.

We are going to test our new fast onboarding workflow next week.

We are also going to invest more in marketing to increase the inbound and outbound leads flow.
