# July 23th, 2023

## Personal

I went to Wikilab to work together with Pedro Arantes, Paulo GDM (Vercel) and Danilo (Sigalei).
It is great to talk and discuss ideas with friends.

I also meet Isaac that is building [Leme Tech](https://www.instagram.com/Leme.tec_/).
A product to help public school managers.

## Woovi

We are going to be at [Forum E-commerce Brasil](https://eventos.ecommercebrasil.com.br/), you should come visit us.

I wrote more 4 technical articles about cool stuff we are building at Woovi
