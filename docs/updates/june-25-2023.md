# June 25th, 2023

## Personal

I gave my talk Intern to CTO to [Dev Stack Summit](https://www.devstacksummit.com/).
You can check the slides and watch the talk here [Sibelius' Talks](../talks)

`cc @sseraphini` twitter API was suspended, so I have to pay 100usd to keep `cc @sseraphini` alive on Twitter,
or just retweet manually myself.
My current patreon [https://www.patreon.com/sibelius](https://www.patreon.com/sibelius) is only at 52usd, so
if you want to see `cc @sseraphini` back sponsor me.

I will participate in a podcast this week about Eficiency, how to do many things with a small team,
let me know if you have any topics that I should cover there

## Woovi

We unblocked a lot our team: m1, whatsapp, sales, many well written issues ready for development.

We are going to test our new product Pix Crediary with a few customers in production next week,
if you are interested in testing it, I can put in the beta.

We improved a lot our bank as a service integration.
