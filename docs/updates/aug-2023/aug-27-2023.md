## Woovi

We launched a lot of improvements in our platform to pizza stores.
Quick view for charges, realtime updates for charges, easy integration for Wabiz partner, sound and a new payment is received.

We shipped a improved version of our KYC process to suppport better companies with more than one
representative.

We improved a lot our sales automation tool to make it easy to track leads/customers, and
what we did talk to them.

We bought a hardware to run our Dev and Staging environment, this will help us reduce our cloud costs.
We are going to run kubernetes on it, similar to production.
We are exposing it to developers using Cloudflare Warp.
