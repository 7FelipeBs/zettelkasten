## Woovi

Woovi (I and [blazu](https://twitter.com/vini_bgoulart)) went to [FEAL SC](https://fealsc.com.br/) - Products, Services and Equipment fair for Food Operators.

We learned more about how Woovi can help food operators to improve their business.
Woovi for pizza places, for restaurants, for deliveries, for coffe shops.

Food service is one of our niche markets that we are exploring.

We finished the new version of Maquiniha Pix using Electron to fix all the issues in Windows.

We have 3 new job openings, if you know someone that would like to work with us, let me know.
